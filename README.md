### Purpose:
The purpose of this project is to investigate the alcohol by volume (ABV) and international bitterness unit (IBU) values of a variety of beers. The specific task was to explore the Beers.csv and Breweries.csv datasets and report on any interesting findings we uncover through our analysis. 

### Conclusion:
We found that alcohol by volume (ABV) and the international bitterness units (IBU) are important to consider in the context of beers. They also appear to be key factors in determining the difference between IPAs and other types of ales, which may imply that the process from brewing beers to distributing the finalized products for sale should take ABV and IBU into consideration. It is important to note that more data is needed to make such claims. We highlight the potential importance of ABV and IBU and provide insights with regard to what it could provide.

We also found that the proportion of IPAs and other ales across the USA differ by state. Although we have no information on the sales, this finding gives us a clue as to where IPAs are more prevalent. However, what this means in terms of action plans is inconclusive. This may serve as a lead for more questions and what other data we should explore for further insights.
