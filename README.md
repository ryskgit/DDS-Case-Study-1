### Purpose:
The purpose of this project is to investigate the alcohol by volume (ABV) and international bitterness unit (IBU) values of a variety of beers. The specific task was to explore the Beers.csv and Breweries.csv datasets and report on any interesting findings we uncover through our analysis. 

### Codebook:
The Excel file codebook explains the variables in the two datasets mentioned above. The codebook also includes information on all dataframes created within the RMarkdown file. Additional tabs in the codebook provide details explaining the variables for the three key dataframes that were used for the main analyses. All dataframes and variables in the codebook originated from the Beers.csv or Breweries.csv files provided, were created using the variables in those files, or were pulled from a resource available through R. 

### RMarkdown: 
The RMarkdown file contains all the code necessary to generate all results from importing the raw data to conducting the analyses. The only that should be changed is the directory at the start of the file that determines where the Beers.csv and Breweries.csv files are located. 

### Conclusion:
We found that alcohol by volume (ABV) and the international bitterness units (IBU) are important to consider in the context of beers. They also appear to be key factors in determining the difference between IPAs and other types of ales, which may imply that the process from brewing beers to distributing the finalized products for sale should take ABV and IBU into consideration. It is important to note that more data is needed to make such claims. We only mean to highlight to potential importance of ABV and IBU and speculations as to what it could provide.

We also found that the proportion of IPAs and other ales across the USA differ by state. Although we have no information on the sales, this finding gives us a clue as to where IPAs are more prevalent. However, what this means in terms of action plans is inconclusive. This may serve as a lead for more questions and what other data we should explore for further insights.
