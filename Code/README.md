### RMD File
The RMarkdown file contains all the code necessary to generate all results from importing the raw data to conducting the analyses. The only that should be changed is the directory at the start of the file that determines where the Beers.csv and Breweries.csv files are located.

### HTML File
The HTML files contains the RMarkdown output as an html file. 

### Codebook
The Excel file codebook explains the variables in the two datasets mentioned above. The codebook also includes information on all dataframes created within the RMarkdown file. Additional tabs in the codebook provide details explaining the variables for the three key dataframes that were used for the main analyses. All dataframes and variables in the codebook originated from the Beers.csv or Breweries.csv files provided, were created using the variables in those files, or were pulled from a resource available through R.
